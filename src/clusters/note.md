# Notice

This feature is still under heavy development and most likely will not be introduced in tjdb 2.0.0, but most likely around the release of tjdb 2.1.0
Depending on issues release may be delayed until later versions. 

### Additional Note

Once the base feature is released, it will not be a finished product, multiple features will most likely be added in versions to come
This cluster feature will allow for both vertical or horozontal scalling, putting tjdb on par with more developed DB programs
